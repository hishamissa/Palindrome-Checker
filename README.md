# Palindrome-Checker
A super simple program that checks whether or not a word is a Palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. Utilizes a simple UI. Developed using JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

This is done by obtaining the word input in the text box, cleaning the input to remove unneccesary symbols/characters, reversing the string and comparing it to the original input and printing the result.
